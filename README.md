I defrosted a 4-year old project, thanks to [this tweet ("Love in the Age of Google")](https://twitter.com/brian_bilston/status/1031844013236789248).
Also, a lot of inspiration from various xkcd experiments with Google search (such as ["I should have"](https://xkcd.com/458/)  and ["stripped game of life"](https://xkcd.com/696/)).

Looking for interesting phrases. (Found one? Share it!)

Also, since this project is old, I would have started it with better modularizaiton (Vue?) + texts in url bar. If you want to fork it, go for it.
